# drawterm
Terminal ASCII/ANSI art/animation creating application.

# Building the program
Its as simple as typing:

~ make

As of now you do not have the:

~ make install

Option it will be added later. If you want to install it copy the drawterm executable
after running make to your /usr/bin. This way you can access it more easily from your
shell.
